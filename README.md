Installing web3js using npm install

Hello,
I want to write a guide for installing web3js using npm install.

This guide is only for windows

1. Download nodejs installer from the website.
2. Install nodejs with default options selected. Most important is to check the option asking of installing all essential files like python c++.
    So after the nodejs is installed, wait for a while and Powershell will pop up and continue installing essential libraries.
3. Open command prompt from location : pathofnodejsfolder/
4. npm install --upgrade request
   npm install --upgrade mkdirp
   npm install web3
